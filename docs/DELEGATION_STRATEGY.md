# Delegation Strategy — autoD Production Implementation

**Created:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** Active
**Orchestrator:** Claude Code Project Orchestrator

---

## Overview

This document maps the 10-phase implementation plan to specialized sub-agents for parallel execution. This represents a **change from the original approach** where all work would be done sequentially by a single agent.

**Key Change:** Transitioning from sequential single-agent execution → parallel multi-agent delegation for faster completion and specialized expertise.

| 5: Deduplication | `python-development:python-pro` | SHA-256 hashing and file utilities | 30 min |
| 6: Vector Store | `python-development:python-pro` | OpenAI SDK integration, async patterns for vector store API | 60 min |
| 7: API Client | `python-development:python-pro` | Tenacity retry logic, exponential backoff, circuit breaker | 45 min |
| 8: Token Tracking | `python-development:python-pro` | tiktoken integration for o200k_base encoding | 30 min |
| 9: Main Processor | `backend-development:backend-architect` | Orchestration logic, pipeline design, batch processing | 90 min |
| 10: Testing | `full-stack-orchestration:test-automator` | Master of pytest, coverage analysis, CI/CD integration | 120 min |
| Continuous: Docs | `documentation-generator:technical-writer` | Real-time CHANGELOG, ADRs, architecture docs | Ongoing |

## Parallelization Strategy

### Wave 1: Foundation (Start Immediately)
- **deployment-engineer**: Phase 0 (Infrastructure)
  - Git initialization, .gitignore, requirements.txt, directory structure
  - **Blocks:** All subsequent phases

### Wave 2: Core Systems (After Phase 0)
- **python-pro**: Phase 1 (Configuration) — 30 min
- **database-architect**: Phase 2 (Database) — 60 min
- **Parallel execution:** Both can start after Phase 0 completes

### Wave 3: AI/ML Layer (After Phases 1-2)
- **python-pro**: Phase 3 (Schema) + Phase 4 (Prompts) — 105 min total (parallel)
- **python-pro**: Phase 5 (Deduplication) — 30 min
- **Can run:** Phases 3 and 4 simultaneously, then Phase 5

### Wave 4: Integration (After Phase 3-5)
- **python-pro**: Phase 6 (Vector Store) — 60 min
- **python-pro**: Phase 7 (API Client) — 45 min (parallel with Phase 6)
- **python-pro**: Phase 8 (Token Tracking) — 30 min (parallel with Phases 6-7)

### Wave 5: Pipeline Assembly (After Phases 6-8)
- **backend-architect**: Phase 9 (Main Processor) — 90 min
- **Integrates:** All previous phases into cohesive pipeline

### Wave 6: Quality Assurance (After Phase 9)
- **test-automator**: Phase 10 (Testing & Production) — 120 min
- **Validates:** Entire system with >90% coverage

### Continuous: Documentation
- **technical-writer**: Tracks all phase completions, creates ADRs, updates CHANGELOG
- **Frequency:** After each phase completion + daily progress snapshots

## Communication Protocol

### Phase Handoff Format

When a phase completes, the agent will report:

```json
{
  "phase": "0",
  "agent": "deployment-engineer",
  "status": "complete",
  "completion_time": "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z",
  "artifacts_created": [
    ".gitignore",
    "requirements.txt",
    "requirements-dev.txt",
    "src/__init__.py",
    "src/logging_config.py"
  ],
  "validation_passed": true,
  "validation_results": {
    "git_initialized": true,
    "dependencies_installable": true,
    "logging_config_valid": true
  },
  "notes": "All validation gates passed. Ready for Phase 1 (Config) and Phase 2 (Database).",
  "blockers": []
}
```

### Documentation Updates

After each phase, **technical-writer** will:
1. Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with phase completion
2. Create ADR if architectural decision made (e.g., `docs/decisions/ADR-001-alembic-migrations.md`)
3. Update `docs/architecture.md` with implementation details
4. Update `docs/progress.md` with current status
5. Commit changes with message: `docs: Phase N complete - [brief description]`

---

## Validation Gates

Each agent must pass these validation gates before declaring phase complete:

| Phase | Validation Command | Success Criteria |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| 0 | `git log --oneline` | Shows initial commit |
| 0 | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | Succeeds in clean venv |
| 1 | `python -c "from src.config import Config; Config()"` | Raises error if OPENAI_API_KEY missing |
| 2 | `alembic upgrade head && alembic downgrade -1` | Both succeed |
| 3 | `pytest tests/test_schema.py` | 20+ invalid cases rejected |
| 4 | Token count benchmark | >90% cache hit rate |
| 5 | `pytest tests/test_dedupe.py` | 0% false negatives |
| 6 | Vector store recovery test | Survives cache deletion |
| 7 | Retry logic test | 5xx errors trigger 5 retries |
| 8 | Token accuracy test | Within 1% of OpenAI response |
| 9 | End-to-end test | 100 PDFs in <5 minutes |
| 10 | Coverage report | >90% test coverage |

## Critical Path

**Sequential Dependencies (Cannot Parallelize):**
1. Phase 0 (git init) → **BLOCKS ALL**
2. Phase 1 (config) → **BLOCKS** Phases 2-9
3. Phase 2 (models) → **BLOCKS** Phases 5, 9
4. Phase 3 (schema) → **BLOCKS** Phases 4, 9
5. Phase 9 (processor) → **BLOCKS** Phase 10

**Critical Path Time:** 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 9 = 45 + 30 + 60 + 60 + 90 = **285 minutes (4.75 hours)**

**With Parallelization:** Phases 3-8 can overlap, reducing total time to **~5 hours** (vs. 6-7 sequential).

---

## Change Management

**Reference Document:** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CHANGES.md`

All deviations from the original plan will be tracked in a separate changes document, including:
- Why the change was made
- Impact on timeline/architecture
- Approval status
- Rollback procedure if needed

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Orchestrator** creates this delegation strategy
2. ⏳ **Orchestrator** creates implementation changes tracking document
3. ⏳ **Orchestrator** delegates Phase 0 to deployment-engineer
4. ⏳ **technical-writer** begins continuous documentation tracking
5. ⏳ Monitor Phase 0 progress and prepare Wave 2 delegation
