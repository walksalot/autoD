## Context

The autoD project technical debt analysis (October 2025) revealed a **Debt Score of 420/1000** (Moderate) with specific pain points impeding development velocity and quality:

**Critical Findings:**
- **No CI/CD pipeline**: Manual testing required before every commit (21.6K/year cost)
- **Missing test automation**: 45% estimated coverage vs. 80% target (57.6K/year in bug costs)
- **No code quality enforcement**: Black/mypy/ruff not automated (7.2K/year in code review overhead)
- **Complex functions**: 1 function with 195 lines, cyclomatic complexity 14 (2.4K/year maintenance burden)
- **Untested error paths**: Circuit breaker, retry logic, vector store failures uncovered

**Business Impact:**
- **Development velocity**: 85% of potential (15% loss = 43.2K/year)
- **Production bugs**: ~4 bugs/month at 8 hours each (57.6K/year)
- **Onboarding**: 5 days vs. 2.5 days optimal (3K per developer)
- **Security risk**: No automated vulnerability scanning (potential 50K+ incident)

**Annual Cost of Inaction:** $133,000 (velocity loss + bugs + code review + onboarding)

**Debt Growth Trajectory:**
- 3 months: 420 → 520 (+24%)
- 6 months: 420 → 640 (+52%)
- 12 months: 420 → 780 (+86%)

Without intervention, debt compounds quarterly at 18%, eventually blocking feature development entirely.

## Decision

**Invest 120 hours over 8 weeks** in systematic technical debt reduction following industry best practice of 15-20% sprint capacity for debt remediation (justified by debt score 420/1000 vs. recommended <300):

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Weeks 1-2) - 12 hours, $1,800

**Goal:** Immediate productivity boosts with minimal disruption

1. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (4 hours)
   - Black formatter (auto-fix)
   - Ruff linter with import sorting
   - Mypy strict type checking
   - Detect-secrets baseline
   - ROI: 150% in first month (6 hours/month saved in code review)

2. **Add pytest to venv** (2 hours)
   - Update requirements-dev.txt with pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock
   - Document test execution in README
   - ROI: 200% in first month (4 hours/month saved)

3. **Create GitHub Actions CI pipeline** (6 hours)
   - Multi-version testing (Python 3.9-3.12)
   - Code coverage with Codecov integration
   - Pre-commit hook validation
   - ROI: 133% in first month (8 hours/month instant feedback)

**Expected Savings:** 18 hours/month = $2,700/month = $32,400/year

### Phase 2: Medium-Term Improvements (Weeks 3-6) - 42 hours, $6,300

**Goal:** Reduce maintenance burden and bug rate

1. **Refactor process_document() God Function** (16 hours)
   - Extract 195-line function into 8 pipeline stages
   - Use existing Pipeline pattern from src/pipeline.py
   - Each stage testable in isolation
   - Reduces cyclomatic complexity from 14 → 4 per function
   - Savings: 4 hours/month = $7,200/year

2. **Add test coverage reporting** (4 hours)
   - Install pytest-cov, coverage[toml]
   - Enforce minimum 70% coverage for new code
   - HTML coverage reports in CI
   - Continuous visibility into test gaps

3. **Pin dependencies with requirements-lock.txt** (2 hours)
   - Generate locked requirements with `pip freeze`
   - Add Dependabot for security updates
   - Prevents version drift between environments
   - Savings: 1 security incident/year prevented = $10,000+

4. **Add integration tests for happy paths** (20 hours)
   - End-to-end pipeline tests (PDF → database)
   - API retry on rate limit validation
   - Circuit breaker failure scenarios
   - Error recovery paths
   - Savings: 2 bugs/month prevented = $9,600/year

**Expected Savings:** $26,800/year

### Phase 3: Long-Term Initiatives (Weeks 7-8) - 68 hours, $10,200

**Goal:** Achieve production-grade quality and observability

1. **Comprehensive test suite to 80% coverage** (40 hours)
   - Unit tests for all src/ modules
   - Integration tests for full pipeline
   - Property-based tests with Hypothesis
   - Performance benchmarks (baseline <10s per document P95)
   - Savings: 70% reduction in production bugs = $40,320/year

2. **Add structured logging with OpenTelemetry** (12 hours)
   - Full distributed tracing
   - Automatic instrumentation for requests, SQLAlchemy
   - Spans for each pipeline stage
   - Savings: 50% faster debugging = $10,800/year

3. **Security hardening** (16 hours)
   - Enable Dependabot for security updates
   - Add Snyk/Safety scan to CI
   - Implement secrets scanning
   - Rate limiting per API key
   - API key rotation strategy
   - Savings: Prevent 1 security incident = $50,000+ potential impact

**Expected Savings:** $101,120/year (includes risk avoidance)

## Consequences

### Positive

**Financial Returns:**
- **Total Investment:** $18,000 (120 hours @ $150/hour)
- **Year 1 Savings:** $62,880 (bug reduction + velocity + code review + onboarding)
- **Net Benefit:** $44,880
- **ROI:** 249%
- **Payback Period:** 3 months

**Velocity Improvements:**
- Development velocity: 85% → 95% (+12% throughput)
- Sprint capacity freed: 15% → 5% (10% more feature work)
- Lead time for changes: 3-5 days → <1 day
- Deployment frequency: Manual → Daily (automated CD)

**Quality Improvements:**
- Bug rate: 4 bugs/month → 1.2 bugs/month (-70%)
- Test coverage: 45% → 80% (+77%)
- Code review time: -50% (formatting automated)
- Time to restore service: 4-6 hours → <1 hour

**Developer Experience:**
- Onboarding: 5 days → 2.5 days (-50%)
- Confidence in changes: Medium → High (test coverage)
- Debugging speed: +50% (structured logging + tracing)
- Code review friction: -60% (automated quality gates)

### Negative

**Short-Term Costs:**
- Feature development slowed during 8-week period (30% sprint capacity allocated to debt)
- Learning curve for new patterns (Strangler Fig refactoring, OpenTelemetry)
- Initial CI/CD setup complexity (multi-Python version matrix, coverage thresholds)

**Ongoing Maintenance:**
- Pre-commit hooks require developer discipline
- CI pipeline requires monitoring and occasional fixes
- Test suite requires maintenance as code evolves
- Security scanning may generate false positives

**Technical Risks:**
- Refactoring process_document() could introduce regressions (mitigated by integration tests)
- OpenTelemetry adds observability overhead (<5% performance impact)
- Locked dependencies may conflict with new features (mitigated by Dependabot)

### Neutral

**Process Changes:**
- Monthly tech debt review meetings (30 min/month)
- Quality gates block PR merge if failing (discipline required)
- ADRs required for complexity >15 functions
- Debt budget policy: 2% increase allowed/month, 5% reduction required/quarter

---

## Compliance

This decision aligns with established architectural patterns:

- **ADR-020 (Responses API):** Migrate to OpenAI Responses API during Phase 2 refactoring
- **ADR-021 (Token Budgeting):** Implement `maxTokens: 0` with 4096 fallback in integration tests
- **ADR-022 (Reasoning Effort):** Apply `.minimal` + `.low` verbosity to extractors

**Industry Best Practices:**
- **DORA Metrics:** Targeting elite performers (daily deployments, <1hr MTTR)
- **IT Budget Allocation:** 15% for technical debt remediation (we're allocating 30% for 8 weeks due to high debt score)
- **Test Coverage:** 80% target aligns with industry standard for production systems

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Continue with Status Quo
**Rejected** - Debt compounds at 18% quarterly. Inaction leads to:
- 12-month debt score: 780/1000 (approaching critical)
- Feature velocity degradation continues
- Security incidents increasingly likely
- Developer morale impact from firefighting

**Long-term cost:** $133,000/year ongoing + compounding debt interest

### Alternative 2: Big Bang Rewrite
**Rejected** - High risk, long delivery time:
- 6+ months to rewrite from scratch
- Business value delivery halted
- Integration risks with existing data
- Team knowledge lost during rewrite

**Estimated cost:** $200,000+ with uncertain ROI

### Alternative 3: Gradual Incremental Improvements (No Focused Effort)
**Rejected** - Debt reduction requires dedicated focus:
- Incremental fixes don't address systemic issues
- Debt continues growing faster than fixes applied
- No improvement in CI/CD, testing infrastructure
- Velocity continues declining

**Long-term cost:** $100,000+/year (slower than status quo but not sustainable)

### Alternative 4: Selected Approach (Phased Investment)
**Accepted** - Balanced approach with proven ROI:
- Quick wins validate approach (Phase 1)
- Medium-term improvements reduce bug rate (Phase 2)
- Long-term initiatives achieve production-grade quality (Phase 3)
- Measurable ROI at each phase
- Reversible if business priorities change
