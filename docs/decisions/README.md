# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural choices made during the autoD implementation.

---

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

**Purpose:**
- Document the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Provide context for future maintainers
- Track the evolution of architectural thinking
- Enable informed decision-making

---

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Title]

**Status:** [Proposed|Accepted|Rejected|Superseded|Deprecated]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** [Who made this decision]

## Context

[What is the issue motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision

[What is the change we're proposing/doing?]

## Consequences

[What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change?]

### Positive
- [Benefits]

### Negative
- [Drawbacks]

### Neutral
- [Neutral impacts]

## Alternatives Considered

[What other options did we consider?]

## Implementation Notes

[Specific implementation details]
```

## Current ADRs

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| [0001](/Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD/docs/decisions/0001-iterative-phasing-over-parallel-development.md) | Iterative Phasing Over Parallel Development | ✅ Accepted | 2025-10-16 |

---

## Planned ADRs

These ADRs will be created as architectural decisions are made during implementation:

| Number | Title | Expected Phase | Status |
|--------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 0002 | Database Selection (PostgreSQL vs SQLite) | Phase 2 | ⏳ Pending |
| 0003 | Vector Store Implementation Strategy | Phase 6 | ⏳ Pending |
| 0004 | Structured Output Schema Design | Phase 3 | ⏳ Pending |
| 0005 | Prompt Caching Optimization Approach | Phase 4 | ⏳ Pending |
| 0006 | Transaction Safety Pattern | Phase 2 | ⏳ Pending |
| 0007 | Retry Logic Strategy | Phase 7 | ⏳ Pending |

---

## Naming Convention

**Format:** `NNNN-brief-title.md`

**Examples:**
- `0001-iterative-phasing-over-parallel-development.md`
- `0002-database-selection-postgresql-vs-sqlite.md`
- `0003-vector-store-implementation-strategy.md`

**Numbering:**
- Zero-padded 4 digits (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Sequential numbering
- No gaps in sequence

---

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Proposed** | Under consideration, not yet approved |
| **Accepted** | Approved and active |
| **Rejected** | Considered but not adopted |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by a newer ADR |
| **Deprecated** | No longer relevant |

---

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- **Architecture patterns** (e.g., pipeline vs. monolithic processing)
- **Technology selection** (e.g., SQLite vs. PostgreSQL)
- **API design** (e.g., Responses API vs. Chat Completions)
- **Data modeling** (e.g., JSON vs. JSONB)
- **Error handling** (e.g., retry strategies, transaction patterns)
- **Testing approaches** (e.g., mocking strategies, coverage targets)
- **Deployment strategies** (e.g., Docker vs. native, CI/CD)

**Rule of Thumb:** If the decision could be reversed or questioned later, document it with an ADR.

---

## ADR Workflow

### 1. Propose
- Create ADR file with Status: **Proposed**
- Document context, alternatives, and recommendation
- Share with stakeholders for review

### 2. Review
- Discuss trade-offs and implications
- Refine based on feedback
- Consider implementation complexity

### 3. Decide
- Update Status to **Accepted** or **Rejected**
- Add decision date and deciders
- Document final reasoning

### 4. Implement
- Reference ADR in code comments
- Update ADR with implementation notes
- Link to related code/PRs

### 5. Evolve
- Update Status if superseded
- Create new ADR for significant changes
- Maintain history via git
