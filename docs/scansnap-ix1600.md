## Overview

The **Fujitsu ScanSnap iX1600** is a high-speed duplex document scanner designed for both personal and small team use. It is the primary hardware device that Paper Autopilot is built to support.

### Key Features

**Performance:**
- **Fast duplex scanning:** Up to 40 pages per minute (ppm), or 80 images per minute (ipm) in duplex mode (A4 size, color @ 300 dpi)
- **Automatic Document Feeder (ADF):** Holds up to 50 sheets with multi-sheet feed detection and brake rollers to prevent jams
- **Paper handling:** Supports documents, receipts, cards, photos, and long paper up to nearly 34 inches

**Interface:**
- **4.3-inch touchscreen:** Intuitive color touchscreen panel for one-touch scanning and profile selection
- **Up to 30 profiles:** Configure and display as icons for quick selection (e.g., scan to PC, to a folder, to cloud)

**Connectivity:**
- **USB 3.2:** Direct connection to Mac or PC
- **Wi-Fi (2.4GHz/5GHz):** Wireless scanning capability, allowing the scanner to be shared or placed away from the computer
- **Note:** Initial Wi-Fi setup is done via the ScanSnap Home software or mobile app

**Platform Support:**
- Works with **macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later** and Windows via the ScanSnap Home software
- **No TWAIN driver:** The scanner uses Fujitsu's proprietary driver, so third-party apps cannot directly control it
- Must use ScanSnap Home software or integrations

**Image Processing:**
- **Optical resolution:** Up to 600 dpi with intelligent image processing
- **Features:** Auto color detection, de-skew, blank page removal, red-eye removal for photos
- **Duplex scanning:** Captures both sides in one pass
- **OCR:** Can generate searchable PDFs via OCR through ScanSnap Home software

**File Formats:**
- Outputs **PDF** (including searchable PDFs) and **JPEG**
- Can convert scans to editable **Word, Excel, or PowerPoint** files using built-in conversion tools

### Using on macOS

To use the iX1600 on a Mac:

1. **Install ScanSnap Home software** (available from Fujitsu/Ricoh)
2. **Connect via USB** for straightforward setup, or **via Wi-Fi** after initial configuration
3. **Note:** The Mac will not recognize the scanner as a generic device (it won't appear in Image Capture) because it uses ScanSnap's proprietary driver

**Important:** ScanSnap Home must be installed and running whenever you want to scan to your Mac.

After setup, you can initiate scans either:
- By pressing the **scan button** on the iX1600's touchscreen (selecting a profile)
- By using the **ScanSnap Home interface** on the Mac

## ScanSnap Home Software on Mac

**ScanSnap Home** is Fujitsu's all-in-one scanning and document management application for ScanSnap scanners. It serves as the hub for configuring the scanner, scanning documents, and organizing scanned files.

### Key Features

**Profiles and One-Touch Scanning:**
- Set up **scan profiles** that define settings like:
  - Resolution, color mode
  - File format (PDF/JPEG)
  - OCR for searchable PDF
  - Save destination or target application
- Profiles can be linked to the scanner's touchscreen icons
- Example profiles:
  - "Scan to PDF (Folder)" with auto-save to specific directory
  - "Scan to Email" with attachment automation
- **One-touch operation:** Select profile on device, press scan button → automatic processing

**Quick Menu Mode:**
- By default, ScanSnap Home uses Quick Menu mode
- After scanning, a popup appears with action choices (save to folder, email, upload to cloud, etc.)
- This adds a manual step after each scan
- **Recommendation:** Disable Quick Menu for automation by configuring specific profiles with fixed actions

**Document Management:**
- Acts as a library for scans
- Default import into ScanSnap Home "content data" system
- Maintains index and thumbnails, categorized by type (documents, receipts, business cards, photos)
- Features: tagging, search, content-based search, automatic file naming using extracted text

**Cloud Integration:**
- Connect to cloud services: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Evernote, Notion, OneNote, etc.
- Configure profiles to send scans to cloud drives
- **ScanSnap Cloud:** Feature for PC-less scanning directly to cloud services

**Mobile and Multi-Device:**
- Mobile app available for iOS/Android
- iX1600 can scan directly to mobile devices via Wi-Fi
- Scanner actively connects to one "host" at a time, but can switch between Mac and mobile

**Installation and Updates:**
- Download latest ScanSnap Home from official website (PFU/Ricoh)
- Supports macOS Catalina 10.15 or later
- Check for updates regularly for compatibility with latest macOS versions

### Default Save Location

**Path:** `~/Documents/ScanSnap Home`

When using standard profiles that save to ScanSnap Home, PDFs/JPEGs land in this folder.

**Important:**
- ScanSnap Home tracks these files internally
- Moving, renaming, or deleting files via Finder (outside the app) will break the app's tracking
- If using the app's library features, let it manage the files
- For automation workflows, consider using custom save locations (see below)

### Custom Save Locations

**Changing the Library Folder:**
- Go to **ScanSnap Home > Preferences > General**
- Use "ScanSnap Home folder" setting to choose different location
- App will move existing files to new location

**Scan to Specified Folder:**
- More relevant for automation
- Configure profiles to scan outside the managed library
- In profile settings, under "Save", browse and select any folder (local or network-mounted)
- Examples:
  - `~/Documents/ScannedPDFs/`
  - iCloud Drive folder
  - Network share (via mounted SMB)

This gives flexibility for organizing scans and integrating with other workflows (like Paper Autopilot's file monitoring).

## Scanning Workflow and Profile Setup

### Typical Workflow

1. **Load documents** into the iX1600's feeder (or single sheet/card/receipt)
   - Scanner can handle mixed paper sizes
   - Auto-detects color vs. grayscale vs. blank pages

2. **Initiate scan:**
   - Press **scan button** on iX1600's touchscreen, or
   - Click **"Scan"** button in ScanSnap Home on Mac
   - If using scanner button, ensure desired profile is selected via touchscreen

3. **Post-scan processing** (depends on profile settings):
   - **With Quick Menu:** Popup appears → manually choose action → confirm filename/location
   - **Without Quick Menu (dedicated profile):** Auto-saves to predetermined location with auto-generated name
     - **Recommended for automation** → no manual intervention needed

### Creating an Auto-Save Profile (No Manual Prompts)

For Paper Autopilot integration, configure a profile that saves directly to a folder without user prompts:

**Steps:**

1. **Create or Edit Profile:**
   - In ScanSnap Home main window, click "Scan" button to open settings
   - Add new profile or modify existing one
   - Set "Managing options – Type" to **"Mac (Scan to file)"**
     - This tells software to save file to disk, not manage as content record

2. **Choose Destination Folder:**
   - In profile's save settings, select **"Save to Folder"**
   - Browse to desired folder (e.g., `~/Documents/Paper/Inbox/`)
   - Can choose ScanSnap Home folder or separate custom folder
   - Network folders supported if Mac is connected

3. **Disable Filename Prompt:**
   - Ensure **"Save images with new file names after scanning"** is **unchecked**
   - This prevents software from pausing to ask for filename confirmation
   - Auto-generated names will be used instead

4. **Set Output to None:**
   - Set "Application" or "Send to" setting to **"None (Scan to file)"**
   - After saving file, no additional actions occur
   - Pure file output mode

5. **File Format and OCR:**
   - Configure format as **PDF** for documents
   - **Optional:** Enable **"Convert to Searchable PDF"** for OCR
     - Note: OCR runs as background process after save
     - PDF will include text layer for keyword search
   - If OCR not needed or done separately, leave it off for faster results

6. **Profile Icon (Optional):**
   - Give profile meaningful name (e.g., "Scan to PDF - AutoSave")
   - Assign icon image/color
   - Profile syncs to scanner's touchscreen

**Result:** One-step scanning process:
- Load paper → Press scan button → File saved automatically to chosen folder
- No dialogs or manual input required
- Files named automatically (e.g., `20251015_123456.pdf` or `Scan_0001.pdf`)

### Auto-Naming Conventions

ScanSnap Home auto-generates names when not prompting:
- Common formats:
  - `Scan_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.pdf`
  - `YYYY_MM_DD_xxx.pdf`
  - Incremented numbers
- Can adjust naming rules in settings
- Some regions support using document title/date from OCR text

**Tip:** For Paper Autopilot, the exact filename doesn't matter since the app will rename files based on classification and extracted metadata.

## File Storage and Locations

### Default Managed Location

**Path:** `~/Documents/ScanSnap Home/`

- Used when scanning with default managed profiles
- ScanSnap Home creates subfolders or stores files with unique names
- App maintains database of managed files
- **Do not manually alter** if using managed mode

### Custom "Scan to File" Location

When using "Scan to file" profile with custom folder:
- Scans appear in **exact specified folder** (e.g., `~/Documents/Paper/Inbox/`)
- ScanSnap Home will not move or organize them further
- Content management is OFF for these scans
- **Recommended for Paper Autopilot:** Separate folder for clean integration

**Examples:**
- `~/Documents/Paper/Inbox/` ← Paper Autopilot watches this
- `~/Documents/Scans/`
- iCloud Drive folder for sync
- Network share (must be mounted on Mac)

### File Naming

Default auto-naming when not prompting:
- `Scan2025_1015_0001.pdf`
- `Scan_20251015_123456.pdf`
- Timestamp or incremented number format

Naming rules can sometimes be adjusted in profile settings.

### Network Folders

**Via Mac (Recommended):**
- Set save folder to mounted network path (SMB share)
- Scanner sends file through Mac to network location
- **Requirement:** Mac must be on and connected at scan time

**Direct to NAS (PC-less, newer firmware):**
- iX1600 gained ability to scan directly to NAS SMB share
- Requires profile configuration via ScanSnap Home
- Scanner must be on Wi-Fi and able to access share
- **Note:** If Paper Autopilot runs on Mac, using Mac as receiver is simpler

## Monitoring New Scanned Files

For Paper Autopilot to automatically process scans, the application monitors the scan output directory and detects new files in real-time.

### FSEvents API (Recommended Approach)

**macOS FSEvents** provides efficient, real-time notifications for filesystem changes:

- **How it works:**
  - Subscribe to notifications for specific directory
  - Get notified when files are created, modified, or deleted
  - Efficient – no polling required
  - Can watch entire folder hierarchy including subfolders

- **Implementation:**
  - Swift/Objective-C: Use `DispatchSourceFileSystemObject` or `FSEventStream`
  - Higher-level: `NSFilePresenter`/`NSFileCoordinator` with delegate methods (e.g., `presentedSubitemDidChangeAtURL:`)
  - Other languages: Libraries like Python's `watchdog` or Node's `fs.watch` leverage FSEvents on Mac

- **Workflow:**
  1. App starts monitoring before scans initiated (runs in background)
  2. When scanning occurs, event callback fires with new file path
  3. App processes file (upload, parse, rename, organize, etc.)

### Practical Considerations

**Debounce/Aggregation:**
- Scanning may create temp file then finalize it
- FSEvents may fire multiple events (created, then modified)
- **Strategy:** Wait for file to stabilize (no modifications for short interval)
- Typically, once scan done, PDF is closed and final event fires
- **Recommended:** Implement slight delay (e.g., 500ms-1s) after detection before processing

**File Identification:**
- If multiple profiles save to different folders, can categorize by location
- Example:
  - `~/Scans/Receipts/` ← Receipts profile
  - `~/Scans/Invoices/` ← Invoices profile
- App can watch parent folder or multiple specific folders

**Testing:**
- Scan sample documents to verify detection
- Check app logs/responses to new file events
- Ensure folder path correct and app has permissions
  - macOS privacy settings may require "Files and Folders" access for Documents folder

**Permissions:**
- On newer macOS, accessing Documents folder requires user permission
- May need to add permission in app's plist for "Files and Folders" access

### Alternative: Folder Polling

- Periodically check directory for new files (compare to previously seen)
- Simpler but less efficient, has slight lag
- **Not recommended** given macOS robust event system
- Could serve as fallback

### macOS Folder Actions (AppleScript)

- Attach AppleScript to folder via Finder's Folder Actions
- Runs when new items added
- More user-level automation
- **Not needed** if writing custom app with FSEvents

### Example FSEvents Use Case

Paper Autopilot's `FileWatcher` (Phase 2) already implements FSEvents monitoring for the inbox directory:

```swift
// From ingestion/FileWatcher.swift
let eventStream = FSEventStreamCreate(
    nil,
    callback,
    &context,
    [watchPath] as CFArray,
    FSEventStreamEventId(kFSEventStreamEventIdSinceNow),
    latency,
    streamFlags
)
```

When ScanSnap saves a new PDF to the watched folder, the FileWatcher:
1. Detects the new file via FSEvents callback
2. Validates it's a PDF
3. Creates an ingestion job in the queue
4. Job queue processes: deduplication → OCR → classification → extraction → organization

**This is exactly the integration point for the ScanSnap iX1600.**

## Additional Tips and Troubleshooting

### Scanner Availability

- **iX1600 can only actively connect to one device at a time**
- If Mac running ScanSnap Home is connected, keep app open (or ScanSnap Manager in menu bar)
- If scanner sleeps or loses connection (especially Wi-Fi), files won't be saved until reconnection
- **Tip:** Adjust scanner's auto-power-off timer in settings to stay ready

### ScanSnap Home State

- Ensure ScanSnap Home not in error state (waiting for pages, prompting for input)
- Well-configured profile should scan and save without attention
- If encountering popups, revisit profile settings to disable them

### Concurrent Scanning

- Avoid scanning new document while app still processing previous one (unless app handles parallel processing)
- Scanner hardware handles one job at a time
- If scanning back-to-back, multiple files appear quickly
- **Ensure:** File watcher logic queues or handles each event properly

### Testing Workflow

- **Simulate:** Copy PDF into watched folder to verify app detection
- Helps verify file monitoring works before scanning real paper
- Check app logs for file detection events

### Software Updates

- **Keep ScanSnap Home updated**
- Vendor periodically releases updates for:
  - New OS version support (e.g., macOS 14, macOS 15 Sequoia)
  - New features (e.g., direct-to-network, improved OCR)
- Compatibility with OS is critical for reliable operation

### Common Issues

**Scanner not detected:**
- Ensure ScanSnap Home is installed and running
- Check USB connection or Wi-Fi status
- Restart scanner and/or ScanSnap Home app

**Files not appearing in folder:**
- Verify profile save location is correct
- Check that "Scan to file" mode is enabled (not managed mode)
- Ensure no filename prompt blocking save
- Check ScanSnap Home logs for errors

**FSEvents not firing:**
- Verify app has permissions to access folder
- Check folder path is absolute and correct
- Test with manual file copy to confirm watcher works

**OCR slow or failing:**
- OCR runs as background process – may take time after save
- Check ScanSnap Home OCR settings
- For Paper Autopilot: Consider disabling ScanSnap OCR and using Apple Vision framework instead (Phase 3)
