## Change History

### Change #001: Multi-Agent Delegation Strategy
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Initiated By:** User (ultrathink directive)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved

**Original Plan:**
- Single agent executes all 8 phases sequentially
- Estimated time: 6-7 hours sequential
- No explicit agent delegation strategy

**New Plan:**
- Multi-agent parallel execution with specialized sub-agents
- 10 phases (added Phase for testing separation)
- Estimated time: ~5 hours with parallelization
- Explicit delegation matrix documented in `DELEGATION_STRATEGY.md`

**Agent Assignments:**
| Phase | Original | New Agent | Reason |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 0: Infrastructure | Generic | `deployment-engineer` | Expert in CI/CD, GitOps patterns |
| 1: Configuration | Generic | `python-pro` | Pydantic V2 expertise |
| 2: Database | Generic | `database-architect` | SQLAlchemy + migrations specialist |
| 3-8: Python modules | Generic | `python-pro` | Modern Python 3.12+ patterns |
| 9: Main Processor | Generic | `backend-architect` | Pipeline orchestration |
| 10: Testing | Generic | `test-automator` | Pytest + coverage specialist |
| Continuous: Docs | None | `technical-writer` | Real-time documentation |

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Faster completion via parallelization (5 vs 7 hours)
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Specialized expertise for each domain
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Better documentation tracking
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Coordination overhead between agents
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk:** Handoff validation gates must be strict

**Timeline Impact:**
- Original: 6-7 hours sequential
- New: ~5 hours with 4-agent parallelization
- **Savings:** 1-2 hours

**Rollback Procedure:**
If multi-agent coordination fails:
1. Complete current in-progress phase
2. Fall back to single-agent sequential execution
3. Document reason for rollback in this file

**Approval:** User-directed via ultrathink command

### Change #002: Continuous Documentation Tracking
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Initiated By:** User (ultrathink directive)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved

**Original Plan:**
- Documentation updates at end of Phase 10
- No real-time progress tracking
- No Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**New Plan:**
- Continuous documentation by `technical-writer` agent
- Real-time updates to CHANGELOG.md after each phase
- ADRs created for all architectural decisions
- Daily progress snapshots in `docs/progress.md`

**New Documentation Artifacts:**
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Phase completion log
- `docs/decisions/ADR-NNN.md` - Architecture Decision Records
- `docs/progress.md` - Real-time status dashboard
- `docs/DELEGATION_STRATEGY.md` - Agent assignment matrix
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_CHANGES.md` - This file

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Better visibility into progress
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Architectural decisions documented in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Easier onboarding for new team members
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Neutral:** Slight overhead for documentation updates

**Timeline Impact:** Negligible (parallel process)

**Approval:** User-directed via ultrathink command

- After each phase completion
- When any agent proposes a deviation
- Daily during active implementation
- Final review after Phase 10
