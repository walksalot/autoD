# Development Model: Parallel Execution with Git Worktrees

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Production-Ready
**Success Stories**: Wave 1 + Wave 2 (3x speedup achieved)

---

## Overview

The **autoD** project uses a **parallel execution strategy** with git worktrees and wave-based progressive integration to accelerate development while maintaining quality gates. This methodology enables **7 parallel Claude Code sessions** to work independently on separate workstreams, then merge through structured integration waves.

**Key Achievement**: 3x speedup (21 days → 7 days) through concurrent workstreams.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Parallel Execution
- **7 independent workstreams** executing concurrently
- Each workstream has dedicated git worktree + Claude Code session
- Isolation prevents merge conflicts during development
- AI agents specialized by task type (python-pro, backend-architect, test-automator)

### 2. Wave-Based Integration
- Progressive merging in 5 waves (vs big-bang integration)
- Each wave merges 1-3 related workstreams to main
- Quality gates enforced at wave boundaries
- Technical debt documented between waves

### 3. Quality-First Merging
- **MyPy strict mode**: Zero type errors before merge
- **Pytest**: 100% pass rate on all tests
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Black, ruff, mypy auto-run
- **Clean merges**: Zero conflicts (isolation working correctly)

### 4. Continuous Documentation
- Session documentation (`docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) for each wave
- ADRs for non-trivial decisions
- CHANGELOG.md updated with every merge
- `docs/overview.md` and `docs/tasks.yaml` synced after each wave

## Git Worktree Workflow

### Initial Setup (7 Parallel Sessions)

```bash
# Create 7 worktrees for parallel development
git worktree add ../autoD-td1 -b workstream/error-handling      # TD1
git worktree add ../autoD-td2 -b workstream/config-management   # TD2
git worktree add ../autoD-td3 -b workstream/mypy-strict         # TD3
git worktree add ../autoD-td4 -b workstream/test-coverage       # TD4
git worktree add ../autoD-ws1 -b workstream/vector-store        # WS1
git worktree add ../autoD-ws2 -b workstream/cache-optimization  # WS2
git worktree add ../autoD-ws3 -b workstream/prod-hardening      # WS3

# Verify all worktrees active
git worktree list
```

### Session-Per-Worktree Pattern

**Each Claude Code session operates in a dedicated worktree:**

1. **TD1** (Error Handling): `~/Developer/autoD-td1`
   - Agent: `python-pro`
   - Focus: CompensatingTransaction consolidation
   - Independent of other workstreams

2. **TD2** (Config Management): `~/Developer/autoD-td2`
   - Agent: `backend-architect`
   - Focus: Pydantic V2 Config class
   - Completed in Wave 1 ✅

3. **TD3** (MyPy Strict): `~/Developer/autoD-td3`
   - Agent: `python-pro`
   - Focus: Type annotations, strict mode
   - Completed in Wave 2 ✅

4. **TD4** (Test Coverage): `~/Developer/autoD-td4`
   - Agent: `test-automator`
   - Focus: Expand coverage from 60.67% → 70%+
   - Deferred to Week 3

5. **WS1** (Vector Store): `~/Developer/autoD-ws1`
   - Agent: `backend-architect`
   - Focus: Vector store implementation
   - Deferred to Week 3 (config added in Wave 1)

6. **WS2** (Cache Optimization): `~/Developer/autoD-ws2`
   - Agent: `backend-architect`
   - Focus: LRU embedding cache
   - Completed in Wave 2 ✅

7. **WS3** (Production Hardening): `~/Developer/autoD-ws3`
   - Agent: `deployment-engineer`
   - Focus: Health checks, metrics, alerting
   - Deferred to Week 3

### Worktree Development Cycle

**Per Workstream:**

1. **Start**: Claude Code opens dedicated worktree directory
2. **Develop**: Work proceeds independently (no main branch updates)
3. **Test**: Local pytest, mypy validation before PR
4. **PR**: Create pull request for wave integration
5. **Merge**: Integration lead merges during wave window
6. **Cleanup**: Remove worktree after successful merge

```bash
# After successful Wave 2 merge
git worktree remove ../autoD-td3  # MyPy strict workstream complete
git worktree remove ../autoD-ws2  # Cache optimization workstream complete
git branch -d workstream/mypy-strict
git branch -d workstream/cache-optimization
```

## Wave-Based Integration Strategy

### Integration Waves (5-Wave Plan)

**Wave 1**: Foundation (Configuration)
- **Workstreams**: TD2 (Config Management)
- **Merge Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Outcome**: 36 environment variables, Pydantic V2, 34 tests ✅

**Wave 2**: Type Safety + Performance
- **Workstreams**: TD3 (MyPy Strict) + WS2 (Cache Optimization)
- **Merge Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Outcome**: 87→0 type errors, 41 cache tests, <0.1ms latency ✅

**Wave 3**: Observability + Resilience (Planned)
- **Workstreams**: TD1 (Error Handling) + WS1 (Vector Store)
- **Target**: Week 3
- **Goal**: Unified error handling, vector store integration

**Wave 4**: Quality + Hardening (Planned)
- **Workstreams**: TD4 (Test Coverage) + WS3 (Production)
- **Target**: Week 3-4
- **Goal**: 70%+ coverage, production metrics

**Wave 5**: Final Integration (Planned)
- **Workstreams**: Any remaining + polish
- **Target**: Week 4
- **Goal**: Production-ready v1.0

### Why Wave-Based vs Big-Bang?

**Problems with Big-Bang Integration:**
- High merge conflict risk (7 concurrent changes)
- Unclear responsibility when tests fail
- Long debugging cycles
- Single point of failure

**Benefits of Wave Integration:**
- **Incremental risk**: 1-3 workstreams per wave
- **Clear ownership**: Each wave has defined scope
- **Early feedback**: Issues caught at wave boundaries
- **Rollback safety**: Can revert single wave if needed
- **Momentum**: Completed waves build confidence

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Merge Requirements (Per Workstream)

**1. MyPy Strict Mode** (Zero Errors)
```bash
mypy src/ tests/ --strict
# Expected: Success: no issues found in 31 source files
```

**2. Pytest** (100% Pass Rate)
```bash
pytest -v
# Expected: All tests passing, no skips/xfails
```

**3. Pre-Commit Hooks** (All Passing)
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
# Expected: black, ruff, mypy all pass
```

**4. Clean Merge** (Zero Conflicts)
- Merge preview on integration branch first
- Resolve any conflicts before wave window
- Final merge to main should be fast-forward

**5. Documentation Updated**
- ADRs created for non-trivial decisions
- CHANGELOG.md entry prepared
- Session doc (`docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) drafted

### Quality Metrics (Wave 2 Example)

**TD3 (MyPy Strict Mode):**
- MyPy errors: 87 → 0 ✅
- Type coverage: 100% on 31 files ✅
- `Any` type leakage: 0 ✅
- Pre-commit: All hooks passing ✅

**WS2 (Cache Optimization):**
- Test count: 41 (100% passing) ✅
- Cache latency: <0.1ms (50x better than target) ✅
- Hit rate: 70%+ ✅
- Throughput: >1M lookups/sec ✅
- Memory efficiency: >90% ✅

**Integration:**
- Merge conflicts: 0 ✅
- Breaking changes: 0 ✅
- Commit count: 8 total
- Files changed: 36 (3,927 insertions, 131 deletions)

## Agent Specialization

### Task-to-Agent Mapping

**python-pro** (Python expertise)
- TD1: Error handling consolidation
- TD3: MyPy strict mode implementation
- Focus: Idiomatic Python, type safety, testing

**backend-architect** (System design)
- TD2: Configuration management architecture
- WS1: Vector store design
- WS2: Cache architecture (LRU, SHA-256 keys)
- Focus: Scalability, performance, maintainability

**test-automator** (Quality engineering)
- TD4: Test coverage expansion
- Focus: Comprehensive test suites, edge cases, property-based testing

**deployment-engineer** (Production reliability)
- WS3: Production hardening
- Focus: Health checks, metrics, alerting, deployment automation

### Agent Invocation Pattern

**In Project Instructions (`CLAUDE.md`):**
```markdown
When working on cache optimization tasks, delegate to the ideal subagent.
If possible, delegate an entire set of plans to the project orchestrator
so he can facilitate parallel worktree development.
```

**In Practice (Wave 2 Example):**
1. **Main Session**: Read requirements, create high-level plan
2. **Task Delegation**: Invoke `backend-architect` for WS2 (cache design)
3. **Parallel Execution**: `backend-architect` works in `../autoD-ws2` worktree
4. **Quality Check**: Main session validates outputs against gates
5. **Integration**: Main session orchestrates merge to main

---

## Session Workflow

### Standard Cycle (Per Wave)

**Phase 1: Start (Session Begin)**
1. Read `docs/overview.md`, `docs/tasks.yaml`, recent sessions
2. Emit ≤400-token "Project Snapshot" summarizing current state
3. Detect documentation drift and propose fixes
4. Understand codebase context before making changes

**Phase 2: Development (Parallel Work)**
1. Create/update workstreams in parallel worktrees
2. Keep `docs/tasks.yaml` updated during work
3. Add ADRs for non-trivial technical decisions
4. Run quality gates locally (mypy, pytest, pre-commit)

**Phase 3: Integration (Wave Merge)**
1. Create integration branch (`integration/waveN`)
2. Merge workstream branches to integration branch
3. Resolve conflicts (should be minimal with good isolation)
4. Run full test suite on integration branch
5. Merge integration branch to main (fast-forward if possible)

**Phase 4: Documentation (Session End)**
1. Write session doc (`docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-waveN-complete.md`)
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with wave entries
3. Update `docs/overview.md` if goals/priorities changed
4. Sync `docs/tasks.yaml` with completed milestones
5. Commit documentation changes with descriptive message
6. Push all changes to remote
7. List next 3 priorities for next session

### Session Documentation Template

## Best Practices (Lessons Learned)

### From Wave 1 & Wave 2

**1. Isolate Configuration Changes Early**
- **Lesson**: Config consolidation (TD2) unblocked all other workstreams
- **Best Practice**: Always complete foundation workstreams (config, schema) in Wave 1

**2. Pair Type Safety with Implementation**
- **Lesson**: MyPy strict + Cache in same wave caught integration issues early
- **Best Practice**: Pair static analysis workstreams with feature workstreams

**3. Document Technical Debt Immediately**
- **Lesson**: `test_search.py` API incompatibility discovered during Wave 2
- **Best Practice**: Add to "Technical Debt" section in session docs, CHANGELOG.md

**4. Use Property-Based Testing for Complex Logic**
- **Lesson**: Hypothesis tests caught cache eviction edge cases
- **Best Practice**: Apply to LRU policies, concurrent access patterns, memory bounds

**5. Enforce Quality Gates Before Integration**
- **Lesson**: Zero mypy errors prevented runtime type issues
- **Best Practice**: Run `mypy --strict` before creating PR

**6. Clean Merge = Good Isolation**
- **Lesson**: Wave 1 & Wave 2 both merged with zero conflicts
- **Best Practice**: If conflicts appear, isolation broke down - investigate root cause

**7. Performance Targets in Tests**
- **Lesson**: Cache performance tests validate <0.1ms latency
- **Best Practice**: Encode SLAs as pytest benchmarks, fail if regression

**8. Session Documentation is Critical**
- **Lesson**: 947-line Wave 2 doc provides complete context for future work
- **Best Practice**: Write comprehensive session docs immediately after merge

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Merge conflicts between worktrees
**Diagnosis**: Worktrees editing same files (isolation failure)
**Solution**: Re-scope workstreams, ensure orthogonal changes

**Problem**: Tests fail after merging to integration branch
**Diagnosis**: Dependency between workstreams not accounted for
**Solution**: Run tests on integration branch before main merge, fix issues there

**Problem**: MyPy errors appear after merge
**Diagnosis**: Pre-merge mypy check not run in worktree
**Solution**: Enforce `mypy --strict` in pre-commit hooks, block PRs with errors

**Problem**: Documentation out of sync with code
**Diagnosis**: Session end workflow skipped
**Solution**: Follow Phase 4 (Documentation) checklist religiously
