## In Progress

### Active Tasks
- ðŸŸ¡ **Awaiting Phase 0 Assignment**
  - Need deployment-engineer to accept Phase 0 (Infrastructure)
  - Estimated duration: 45 minutes
  - Blocks: All subsequent phases

### Monitoring
- ðŸŸ¡ **Continuous Documentation Active**
  - technical-writer standing by for phase handoff reports
  - Auto-update triggers ready
  - Real-time tracking operational

---

## Blockers Resolved

None (initial setup phase had no blockers)

---

## Active Blockers

**Current:** None

**Potential Risks:**
- Agent coordination overhead (low probability, mitigated by clear handoff protocol)
- Integration failures (low probability, mitigated by validation gates)

---

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (Next 1 hour)
1. **Assign Phase 0 to deployment-engineer**
   - Git initialization
   - .gitignore configuration
   - requirements.txt setup
   - Directory structure creation
   - Logging configuration

2. **Monitor Phase 0 Progress**
   - Track validation gate completion
   - Update CHANGELOG.md upon completion
   - Update progress.md with actual timing
   - Create ADR if architectural decisions made

3. **Prepare Wave 2 Delegation**
   - python-pro ready for Phase 1 (Configuration)
   - database-architect ready for Phase 2 (Database)
   - Both can start immediately after Phase 0

### Short-term (Next 2-4 hours)
1. **Wave 2 Execution**
   - Parallel execution of Phases 1-2
   - Monitor validation gates
   - Document any architectural decisions

2. **Wave 3 Preparation**
   - python-pro ready for Phases 3-5
   - Schema, prompts, deduplication

3. **Continuous Documentation**
   - Update all tracking documents after each phase
   - Create ADRs for key decisions
   - Maintain real-time accuracy

### Long-term (Next 5-6 hours)
1. **Waves 4-6 Execution**
   - Phases 6-10 completion
   - Final testing and validation
   - Production readiness

2. **Final Documentation**
   - Complete architecture.md with implementation details
   - Final CHANGELOG.md summary
   - Session retrospective

## Metrics

### Time Tracking
- **Session Start:** 2025-10-16T00:00:00Z
- **Elapsed Time:** ~15 minutes (documentation setup)
- **Planned Phase 0 Start:** Awaiting agent assignment
- **Estimated Completion:** 2025-10-16 (same day, ~5 hours total)

### Documentation Status
- **Files Created Today:** 4
  - CHANGELOG.md
  - progress.md
  - architecture.md
  - sessions/2025-10-16-snapshot-1.md

- **ADRs Created:** 0 (ADR 0001 created earlier by Architecture Sage)
- **Documentation Lag:** 0 minutes (real-time)

### Phase Status
- **Completed:** 0/10
- **In Progress:** 0/10
- **Waiting:** 10/10
- **Blocked:** 0/10

## Observations

### Positive
- **Strong Foundation:** Comprehensive planning and delegation strategy in place
- **Clear Accountability:** Each phase assigned to specialized agent
- **Risk Mitigation:** Validation gates prevent cascading failures
- **Realistic Timeline:** 5-hour critical path is achievable with parallelization

### Concerns
- **Agent Coordination:** First time using multi-agent delegation for this project
  - Mitigation: Clear handoff protocol and validation gates
  - Monitoring: Will track coordination overhead in future snapshots

- **Documentation Overhead:** Continuous documentation requires discipline
  - Mitigation: Automated triggers and clear templates
  - Validation: 5-minute update SLA

### Learnings
- Real-time documentation provides immediate visibility
- Wave-based parallelization reduces critical path effectively
- Clear validation gates essential for multi-agent coordination

---

## Decisions Made

### Documentation Strategy
**Decision:** Establish continuous documentation tracking with 5-minute update SLA

**Rationale:**
- Real-time visibility into progress
- Architectural decisions captured immediately
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Post-mortem analysis support

**Trade-offs:**
- Slight overhead for documentation updates
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Worth it for visibility and knowledge preservation

### Snapshot Frequency
**Decision:** Create snapshots at key milestones (not time-based)

**Rationale:**
- Phase completions are natural boundaries
- More meaningful than arbitrary time intervals
- Reduces noise in session history

**Implementation:**
- Snapshot 1: Project initialization (this file)
- Snapshot 2: After Phase 0 completion
- Snapshot 3: After Wave 2 completion (Phases 1-2)
- Snapshot 4: After Wave 3 completion (Phases 3-5)
- Snapshot 5: After Wave 4 completion (Phases 6-8)
- Snapshot 6: After Wave 5 completion (Phase 9)
- Snapshot 7: After Wave 6 completion (Phase 10, final)
