# Workstream 2: Retry Logic + Error Handling

**Worktree**: autoD-retry-error-handling
**Branch**: workstream/retry-error-handling
**Duration**: 6-8 hours (Day 0-5)
**Dependencies**: Minimal (config patterns only - can run parallel with Workstream 1)

---

## Initial Prompt for Claude Session

```
ultrathink: You are implementing Retry Logic + Error Handling for the autoD project.

CONTEXT - READ THESE FIRST:
- docs/CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md (sections 5-7: Retry Logic, Transaction Safety, Structured Logging)
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md (Week 2: Resilience section)
- docs/CHANGES_FROM_ORIGINAL_PLAN.md (Critical Flaw #4: Incomplete Retry Logic)

WORKFLOW (follow "Explore, Plan, Code, Commit" pattern):
1. EXPLORE: Read the files above, especially the "before/after" examples
2. PLAN: Create implementation plan. DO NOT CODE YET.
3. CODE: After approval, implement incrementally
4. COMMIT: Commit after each major component

DELIVERABLES:
1. Comprehensive retry logic (src/retry.py):
   - is_retryable_api_error() predicate function
   - Handles ALL transient errors: timeouts, 5xx, rate limits, connection errors
   - @retry decorator using tenacity library
   - Exponential backoff: 2-60 seconds, max 5 attempts

2. Compensating transaction pattern (src/transactions.py):
   - CompensatingTransaction context manager
   - Rollback handlers for Files API uploads
   - Database transaction safety
   - Audit trail for partial failures

3. Structured JSON logging (src/logging_config.py):
   - JSONFormatter for machine-readable logs
   - Stage transition logging
   - Error logging with stack traces
   - Performance metrics logging

4. Unit tests with 70%+ coverage

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
‚úÖ Retry logic handles all transient API errors (test with mock failures)
‚úÖ Compensating transactions prevent data loss on partial failures
‚úÖ Structured logs capture all stage transitions (verify JSON format)
‚úÖ 95%+ success rate under simulated API failures
‚úÖ pytest tests/ -v passes
‚úÖ mypy src/ passes

IMPORTANT:
- Follow docs/CODE_ARCHITECTURE.md examples EXACTLY (especially retry predicate)
- Include ALL error types: RateLimitError, APIConnectionError, Timeout, APIError (5xx)
- DO NOT assume async - use synchronous code for now
- DO NOT implement database models (that's Workstream 1)
- DO NOT implement token tracking (that's Workstream 3)

INTEGRATION CHECKPOINT: Day 5
You'll merge into the foundation branch (after Workstream 1 + 4 merge on Day 3).

Ready? Start by reading the docs and creating your plan.

## Progress Tracking

Create `progress.md` in this worktree:

```markdown
# Workstream 2: Retry Logic + Error Handling

**Status**: üü¢ On Track
**Progress**: X/8 tasks complete (X%)
**ETA**: Day 5 (on schedule)

## Completed
- ‚úÖ Task 1

## In Progress
- üîÑ Task 2

## Pending
- ‚è≥ Task 3

## Blockers
- None
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Checklists**: Create `retry_implementation_checklist.md` to systematically track error types and test cases

2. **Give Claude Images**: If you have retry flow diagrams, drag them into the session

3. **Course Correct**: If Claude tries to implement database models, interrupt and redirect

---

## Integration Handoff (Day 5)

**What gets merged**: Retry decorators and transaction patterns that Workstream 1's pipeline stages can use.

**Merge into**: `integration/week1-foundation` branch (after Workstream 1 + 4 are merged).
