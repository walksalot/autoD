# Getting Started with Parallel Execution

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: âœ… Ready to Launch

---

## What's Been Set Up

I've created a complete parallel execution strategy for implementing Week 1 of the autoD project using **4 concurrent Claude Code sessions** working in **git worktrees**. Here's what's ready:

### âœ… Documentation Created

1. **`docs/PARALLEL_EXECUTION_STRATEGY.md`** (comprehensive strategy)
   - Git worktree architecture
   - 4 parallel workstreams with detailed instructions
   - Integration checkpoints (Day 3, 5, 7)
   - Best practices from Claude Code guide
   - Conflict resolution strategies

2. **`PROJECT_MANAGER_GUIDE.md`** (coordination playbook)
   - Day-by-day integration steps
   - Quality gate validation commands
   - Conflict resolution examples
   - Rollback procedures

### âœ… Git Worktrees Created

4 worktrees are ready for parallel development:

```
/Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD                       [main]
/Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD-database-pipeline     [workstream/database-pipeline]
/Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD-retry-error-handling  [workstream/retry-error-handling]
/Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD-testing               [workstream/testing]
/Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD-token-tracking        [workstream/token-tracking]
```

### âœ… Startup Prompts Created

Each worktree has a `STARTUP.md` file with:
- Initial prompt for the Claude session
- Success criteria
- Integration checkpoint information
- Best practices specific to that workstream

## How to Launch Parallel Sessions

### Option 1: Manual Terminal Setup (Recommended)

**Step 1**: Open 5 terminal tabs/windows:
- **Tab 1**: Project Manager (stay in `/Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD`)
- **Tab 2**: Workstream 1 - Database + Pipeline
- **Tab 3**: Workstream 2 - Retry Logic + Error Handling
- **Tab 4**: Workstream 3 - Token Tracking + Cost Monitoring
- **Tab 5**: Workstream 4 - Test Infrastructure

**Step 2**: Start Claude in each workstream tab:

**Tab 2** (Workstream 1):
```bash
cd /Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD-database-pipeline
claude
# When Claude starts, say: "Read STARTUP.md and begin the workstream"
```

**Tab 3** (Workstream 2):
```bash
cd /Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD-retry-error-handling
claude
# When Claude starts, say: "Read STARTUP.md and begin the workstream"
```

**Tab 4** (Workstream 3):
```bash
cd /Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD-token-tracking
claude
# When Claude starts, say: "Read STARTUP.md and begin the workstream"
```

**Tab 5** (Workstream 4):
```bash
cd /Users/krisstudio/Developer/Projects/autoD-testing
claude
# When Claude starts, say: "Read STARTUP.md and begin the workstream"
```

**Step 3**: Use Tab 1 (Project Manager) to monitor progress:
- Read `PROJECT_MANAGER_GUIDE.md` for coordination instructions
- Check progress hourly using the scripts in the guide
- Perform integrations on Day 3, 5, 7

### Option 2: Single-Session Supervised Mode (Alternative)

If you prefer to supervise one Claude session that coordinates the work:

**Stay in this current session** and say:
> "Begin implementing Workstream 1 (Database + Pipeline). Read the STARTUP.md file in the autoD-database-pipeline worktree and implement all deliverables. After Workstream 1 is complete, move to Workstream 2, then 3, then 4."

This is **slower** (sequential instead of parallel) but requires less terminal management.

---

## Timeline Expectations

**Parallel Approach** (4 Claude sessions simultaneously):
- **Day 1-2**: All 4 workstreams make progress in parallel
- **Day 3**: Integrate Workstream 1 + 4 (foundation)
- **Day 4-5**: Workstream 2 continues
- **Day 5**: Integrate Workstream 2 (retry logic)
- **Day 6-7**: Workstream 3 continues
- **Day 7**: Integrate Workstream 3 (token tracking) and deploy to main

**Total: ~7 days** with 4 agents working simultaneously

**Sequential Approach** (1 Claude session):
- **Week 1**: Database + Pipeline (5 days)
- **Week 2**: Retry Logic (3 days)
- **Week 3**: Token Tracking (2 days)
- **Week 4**: Testing (3 days)

**Total: ~13 days** with 1 agent working sequentially

**Benefit of Parallel**: Faster delivery (7 days vs 13), multiple perspectives, earlier integration feedback.

## Integration Checkpoints

### Day 3: Foundation Integration
**Merge**: Workstream 1 (Database + Pipeline) + Workstream 4 (Testing)
**Result**: Testable pipeline foundation
**Quality Gate**: 60%+ test coverage, pipeline processes 1 PDF

### Day 5: Retry Logic Integration
**Merge**: Workstream 2 (Retry Logic + Error Handling)
**Result**: Resilient pipeline with retry logic
**Quality Gate**: 70%+ test coverage, 95%+ API success rate

### Day 7: Final Integration
**Merge**: Workstream 3 (Token Tracking + Cost Monitoring) â†’ Deploy to main
**Result**: Complete Week 1 implementation
**Quality Gate**: 75%+ test coverage, 100 PDFs processed successfully

## What Each Workstream Will Build

### Workstream 1: Database + Pipeline Foundation
**Duration**: 8-12 hours (Day 0-3)
**Deliverables**:
- SQLAlchemy `Document` model with generic JSON type
- Pipeline pattern (ProcessingContext, ProcessingStage ABC, Pipeline orchestrator)
- 5 pipeline stages: SHA-256, dedupe check, upload to Files API, call Responses API, persist to DB
- Unit tests with 80%+ coverage

### Workstream 2: Retry Logic + Error Handling
**Duration**: 6-8 hours (Day 0-5)
**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive retry logic handling all transient errors (timeouts, 5xx, rate limits, connections)
- Compensating transaction pattern for data consistency
- Structured JSON logging for observability
- Unit tests with 70%+ coverage

### Workstream 3: Token Tracking + Cost Monitoring
**Duration**: 4-6 hours (Day 0-7)
**Deliverables**:
- Token counting with tiktoken (o200k_base encoding for GPT-5)
- Cost calculation with GPT-5 pricing ($10/$30 per 1M tokens)
- Logging integration for token/cost metrics
- Unit tests with 90%+ coverage

### Workstream 4: Test Infrastructure
**Duration**: 6-8 hours (Day 0-7)
**Deliverables**:
- pytest configuration with database fixtures
- Mock OpenAI client (Responses API)
- Sample PDF fixtures (generated programmatically)
- Test utilities for assertions and log capture

## Success Metrics

After 7 days, Week 1 should be complete with:

**Functional**:
- âœ… Pipeline processes 100 PDFs successfully
- âœ… Zero duplicate records (SHA-256 deduplication)
- âœ… 95%+ API success rate (retry logic)
- âœ… Token counts accurate within 5%
- âœ… Cost tracking working

**Quality**:
- âœ… 75%+ test coverage
- âœ… All tests pass
- âœ… Type checking passes (mypy)
- âœ… Linting passes (black)
- âœ… Structured logs capture all metrics

**Process**:
- âœ… All 4 workstreams merged cleanly
- âœ… < 5 merge conflicts total
- âœ… < 2 rollbacks required
- âœ… Integration checkpoints met on schedule

---

## Next Steps

**Choose your approach:**

### Parallel Execution (Recommended for Speed)
1. Open 5 terminal tabs
2. Start Claude in tabs 2-5 (one per worktree)
3. Use tab 1 to monitor and coordinate
4. Follow `PROJECT_MANAGER_GUIDE.md` for integration

### Sequential Supervised (Recommended for Control)
1. Stay in this session
2. Ask Claude to implement Workstream 1, then 2, then 3, then 4
3. Less terminal management, but slower overall
